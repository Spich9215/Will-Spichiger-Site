                One lovely Saturday afternoon in August Finn lied restlessly on the carpet. "Maybe I will go to the beach today?"
                "Maybe I will be stuck here all day inside :(". Finn's friend Will grabbed the leash and Finn thought "Yes! I am going outstide"
                Will grabbed the car keys too and let Finn outside and into the car.  Finn loved to look out the window and feel the breeze in his 
                hair.  The salty smell of the ocean was in the air. Finn knew today was going to be a grand adventure.
            </p>

                Will pulled into the beach parking lot and let Finn out of the car.  Finn ran as fast as he could to the beach to see what his dog
                pals were doing.  They sniffed eachother and chased eachother around in the sand and sun.  "What a great day to be me" Finn thought.
                Then Finn caught a whiff of something. "Is that Frank's Red Hot?". It was indeed.  Finn came across a grouping of Chicken Wings in the sand.
                Finn wasn't a picky guy though and there was still some chicken on the bones.  Finn began having a wing. "Could this day get any better?"
            </p>
            <p>
                When Will discovered Finn was chewing on chicken bones he chased Finn.  Finally Finn relented and let Will catch up with him.  Though it
                took some wrestling to pry the chicken wing from Finns mouth.  Will scolded Finn and put him back on leash because Chicken Wings can hurt
                a guy like Finn.  After walking another 200m.  They were friends again and over the chicken wing showdown.  Will let Finn off leash again to play
                with the other dogs in the water and sand.  The end.
