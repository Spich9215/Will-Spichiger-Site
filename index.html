                What is this website supposed to be?
    
                Frankly, I am still undecided. It will be mostly personal brainstorm and perhaps serve as a resume.
    
                In a sense this is an attempt to exercise my first amendment rights to free speech.
    
                Having been born in 1992 a nontrivial portion of my life has been spent consuming of social media data. I
                joined Facebook in February 2008 at the age of 15.
                Me and my contemporaries commonly called Millenials are the inaugural generation of humankind to have grown
                up with the internet and social media.
    
                As I age, I am increasingly less trusting FAANG companies and the data they collect. (Althought )
                Any photo, thought, or comment contributed is no longer mine. I want to retain some control over my
                information and public perception.
    
                These large companies will lull the masses who trade their information for access to web services into a
                sense of security.
                I do not want to give them my data. I do not need their application features nor do I relish the prospect of
                going viral.
                (In all honestly I would love to go viral. This banal desire for attention is deeply embedded in my mortal
                ego.)
    
    
    
                I will need to better outline a roadmap for this website.
                What do I want to showcase?
                What do I want to share?
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
                Rarely was I a producer of content.

            <h2>Biographical Information</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in a North Jersey suburb called Glen Rock. We have a very large rock that is our namesake.
                I spent my entire childhood living in Glen Rock and enjoyed playing sports as a kid and doing outdoor
                activities with the scouts. For college I moved to Austin, Texas to attend the University of Texas.
                Their football
                team got a lot worse upon my arrival but I still had fun in college. I joined a fraternity where I made
                many friends
                and graduated with a degree in economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a brief stint working in Houston I returned home to Glen Rock and began working in Manhattan on
                the Hudson Yards Project.
                Financial Planning and Analysis was interesting at first but got boring. I decided to leave my job and
                travel through Europe and
                Southeast Asia. Vietnam is a cool country. I learned a lot about the soup pho. Pho Ga is chicken soup.
                Pho Bo is beef soup and Pho Ca is fish soup.
                Pho Ga may have been my first words. Anyway, the soup was delicious but I lost a considerable amount of
                weight there. Not much bread and cheese around.
                Returning to the US, I enrolled at Stevens to modernize my skills for a new occupation.
