            <h2>Biographical Information</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in a North Jersey suburb called Glen Rock. We have a very large rock that is our namesake.
                I spent my entire childhood living in Glen Rock and enjoyed playing sports as a kid and doing outdoor
                activities with the scouts. For college I moved to Austin, Texas to attend the University of Texas.
                Their football
                team got a lot worse upon my arrival but I still had fun in college. I joined a fraternity where I made
                many friends
                and graduated with a degree in economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a brief stint working in Houston I returned home to Glen Rock and began working in Manhattan on
                the Hudson Yards Project.
                Financial Planning and Analysis was interesting at first but got boring. I decided to leave my job and
                travel through Europe and
                Southeast Asia. Vietnam is a cool country. I learned a lot about the soup pho. Pho Ga is chicken soup.
                Pho Bo is beef soup and Pho Ca is fish soup.
                Pho Ga may have been my first words. Anyway, the soup was delicious but I lost a considerable amount of
                weight there. Not much bread and cheese around.
                Returning to the US, I enrolled at Stevens to modernize my skills for a new occupation.
